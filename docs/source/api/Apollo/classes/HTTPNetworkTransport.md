> A network transport that uses HTTP POST requests to send GraphQL operations to a server, and that uses `URLSession` as the networking implementation.

## Methods
### `init(url:session:sendOperationIdentifiers:useGETForQueries:delegate:requestCreator:)`

```swift
public init(url: URL,
            session: URLSession = .shared,
            sendOperationIdentifiers: Bool = false,
            useGETForQueries: Bool = false,
            delegate: HTTPNetworkTransportDelegate? = nil,
            requestCreator: RequestCreator = ApolloRequestCreator())
```

> Creates a network transport with the specified server URL and session configuration.
>
> - Parameters:
>   - url: The URL of a GraphQL server to connect to.
>   - session: The URLSession to use. Defaults to `URLSession.shared`,
>   - sendOperationIdentifiers: Whether to send operation identifiers rather than full operation text, for use with servers that support query persistence. Defaults to false.
>   - useGETForQueries: If query operation should be sent using GET instead of POST. Defaults to false.
